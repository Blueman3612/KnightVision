# Lessons Feature Implementation Checklist

## Database Setup

- [ ] Create `player_lessons` table in the database
- [ ] Create new file `app/db/lessons.sql` with table definition
- [ ] Add index on `player_id` for faster queries
- [ ] (Optional) Add migration script if using database migrations

## Models

- [ ] Create `app/models/lessons.py` file
- [ ] Define `LessonExercise` model
- [ ] Define `LessonRequest` model
- [ ] Define `LessonResponse` model
- [ ] Define `LessonCompletionRequest` model

## Lesson Service

- [ ] Create `app/services/lessons.py` file
- [ ] Implement `LessonService` class with the following methods:
  - [ ] `get_player_lessons(player_id)` - retrieve existing lessons
  - [ ] `get_player_games(player_id, limit)` - get recent games
  - [ ] `get_game_blunders(game_id, player_id)` - find blunders in a game
  - [ ] `generate_lesson(blunder_data)` - create lesson from blunder
  - [ ] `store_lesson(player_id, lesson_data)` - save lesson to database
  - [ ] `complete_lesson(lesson_id, score)` - mark lesson as completed
  - [ ] `get_recommended_lessons(player_id, limit)` - get personalized recommendations
- [ ] Create tactic descriptions dictionary
- [ ] Create singleton instance `lesson_service`

## API Routes

- [ ] Create `app/api/routes/lessons.py` file
- [ ] Implement API endpoints:
  - [ ] GET `/lessons/` - retrieve player's lessons
  - [ ] POST `/lessons/generate` - generate new lessons
  - [ ] GET `/lessons/recommendations` - get lesson recommendations
  - [ ] POST `/lessons/{lesson_id}/complete` - mark lesson as completed
- [ ] Add authentication requirements to each endpoint
- [ ] Add proper error handling for each endpoint
- [ ] Add background task processing for lesson generation

## Integration

- [ ] Update `app/api/routes/__init__.py` to import lessons route
- [ ] Update `app/main.py` to include the lessons router
- [ ] Test integration with existing `stockfish_service`
- [ ] Test integration with existing `tactics_service`

## Testing

- [ ] Create `tests/test_lessons.py` file
- [ ] Write unit tests for the lesson service methods
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create test data with known blunders for consistent testing
- [ ] Test background task functionality

## Documentation

- [ ] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger comments
- [ ] Add docstrings to all classes and methods
- [ ] Create example requests and responses for each endpoint
- [ ] Document database schema and relationships

## Deployment

- [ ] Execute database schema changes in production
- [ ] Deploy new code
- [ ] Monitor for any errors during initial usage
- [ ] Set up appropriate logging for lesson generation process

## UI Integration (Frontend Tasks)

- [ ] Create lessons UI components
- [ ] Implement API client for lessons endpoints
- [ ] Create lesson recommendation UI
- [ ] Implement interactive chess exercises
- [ ] Add lesson completion tracking

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed lessons
- [ ] Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for lesson generation
- [ ] Monitor performance of background tasks

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Ensure proper user authentication for all endpoints
- [ ] Validate that users can only access their own lessons
- [ ] Sanitize all inputs, especially FEN strings
- [ ] Prevent excessive resource usage in lesson generation
