# Chess Tutor Project Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Description
The Chess Tutor is a comprehensive web application designed to provide personalized chess training. Unlike generic chess platforms, this application analyzes a user's chess games, identifies specific strengths and weaknesses in their play, and delivers tailored lessons and practice positions to address those weaknesses. Additionally, it offers adaptive gameplay by adjusting its playing strength to match the user's skill level.

### 1.2 Project Objectives
- Create an intuitive platform for chess improvement
- Implement sophisticated game analysis capabilities
- Deliver personalized learning content based on user weaknesses
- Provide adaptive practice through custom positions and gameplay
- Establish a scalable and maintainable technical foundation

### 1.3 Key Features
- PGN upload and analysis
- Strength/weakness identification
- Personalized lesson recommendations
- Custom practice position generation
- Adaptive strength gameplay (matching user's ELO)
- Progress tracking and improvement metrics

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Architecture Overview
The application follows a modern three-tier architecture:
- **Frontend**: Client-facing interface built with Next.js
- **Backend API**: Server-side processing using FastAPI with Stockfish integration
- **Database**: User data and game storage using Supabase

## 3. Development Approach

### 3.1 MVP Development Strategy
The development follows a phased approach with early deployment:

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
- Basic Stockfish API deployed on EC2 via Docker
- Game playability against Stockfish in Next.js frontend
- Supabase integration for authentication and data storage
- Complete deployment pipeline establishment

#### Phase 2: Analysis Capabilities
- PGN upload and parsing
- Game analysis with Stockfish
- Basic strength/weakness identification
- Game storage and retrieval

#### Phase 3: Personalization Features
- Advanced weakness identification algorithms
- Lesson content creation and recommendation system
- Custom position generation based on user weaknesses
- Adaptive gameplay strength adjustment

#### Phase 4: Refinement
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness enhancements
- Advanced analytics and progress tracking

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Local Development Environment**:
   - Frontend: Next.js development server
   - Backend: Docker containerized FastAPI with Stockfish
   - Database: Supabase project (development instance)

2. **Version Control**:
   - Git repository with feature branching model
   - Pull request review process

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for backend logic (pytest)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend component testing (React Testing Library)
   - Manual testing for chess-specific functionality

## 4. Detailed Implementation Plan

#### 4.1.1 Stockfish Integration
- Containerized Stockfish engine on EC2
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - Game initiation
  - Move validation and execution
  - Position evaluation
  - Game state management
- UCI protocol implementation for Stockfish communication
- Configuration for variable playing strength

#### 4.1.2 Game Analysis Engine
- PGN parsing and validation
- Move accuracy evaluation using Stockfish
- Pattern recognition for identifying:
  - Tactical weaknesses (missed forks, pins, etc.)
  - Positional weaknesses (pawn structure, piece activity)
  - Opening knowledge gaps
